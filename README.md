Surveillance â€“ Protective Measures

We would like to design a system to operate together with a lock to

deny entrance to risk-carrying people and
gather data for monitoring purposes.
The system should check whether the person attempting to enter the building

  wears a face mask,
  wears a mask properly,
  does not show symptoms such as fever or similar
a nd deny entrance if

these requirements are not fully satisfied or
the building is highly populated (based on the data collected at the gates)
and indicate the reason for denial.
